  ABSTRACT =      {This report reviews the Open Automated Demand Response (OpenADR) deployments 
within the territories serviced by California’s investor-­‐owned utilities (IOUs) and the 
transition from the OpenADR 1.0 specification to the formal standard—OpenADR 2.0.  
As demand response service providers and customers start adopting OpenADR 2.0, it 
is necessary to ensure that the existing Automated Demand Response (AutoDR) infrastructure 
investment continues to be useful and takes advantage of the formal standard and its many 
benefits.  This study focused on OpenADR deployments and systems used by the California IOUs 
and included a summary of the OpenADR deployment from the U.S.  Department of Energy-­‐funded
 demonstration conducted by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD).  Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory collected and analyzed data about OpenADR 1.0 deployments, categorized 
architectures, developed a data model mapping to understand the technical compatibility of 
each version, and compared the capabilities and features of the two specifications.  The 
findings, for the first time, provided evidence of the total enabled load shed and average first 
cost for system enablement in the IOU and SMUD service territories.  The OpenADR 2.0a profile 
specification semantically supports AutoDR system architectures and data propagation with a 
testing and certification program that promotes interoperability, scaled deployments by 
multiple vendors, and provides additional features that support future services.},

In this paper we propose a job power aware scheduling mechanism to reduce {HPC's} electricity bill without degrading the system utilization. The novelty of our job scheduling mechanism is its ability to take the variation of electricity price into consideration as a means to make better decisions of the timing of scheduling jobs with diverse power profiles. We verified the effectiveness of our design by conducting trace-based experiments on an {IBM} Blue {Gene/P} and a cluster system as well as a case study on Argonne's 48-rack {IBM} Blue {Gene/Q} system. Our preliminary results show that our power aware algorithm can reduce electricity bill of {HPC} systems as much as 23\%.},

	abstract = {Virtualized infrastructure providers demand new methods to increase the accuracy of the accounting models used to charge their customers. Future data centers will be composed of many-core systems that will host a large number of virtual machines ({VMs)} each. While resource utilization accounting can be achieved with existing system tools, energy accounting is a complex task when per-{VM} granularity is the goal. In this paper, we propose a methodology that brings new opportunities to energy accounting by adding an unprecedented degree of accuracy on the per-{VM} measurements. We present a system -which leverages {CPU} and memory power models based in performance monitoring counters ({PMCs)-} to perform energy accounting in virtualized systems. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we show that {PMC-based} power modeling methods are still valid on virtualized environments. And second, we introduce a novel methodology for accounting of energy consumption in virtualized systems. In overall, the results for an Intel® Core™ 2 Duo show errors in energy estimations below the 5\%. Such approach brings flexibility to the chargeback models used by service and infrastructure providers. For instance, we show that {VMs} executed during the same amount of time, present more than 20\% differences in energy consumption even only taking into account the consumption of the {CPU} and the memory.},

We propose the Globus Architecture for Reservation and Allocation ({GARA)} to address these four issues. {GARA} treats both reservations and computational elements such as processes, network flows, and memory blocks as first-class entities, allowing them to be created, monitored, and managed independently and uniformly. It simplifies management of heterogeneous resource types by defining uniform mechanisms for computers, networks, disk, memory, and other resources. Layering on these standard mechanisms, {GARA} enables the construction of application-level co-reservation and co-allocation libraries that applications can use to dynamically assemble collections of resources, guided by both application {QoS} requirements and the local administration policy of individual resources. We describe a prototype {GARA} implementation that supports three different resource type-parallel computers, individual {CPU} under control of the dynamic soft real-time scheduler, and integrated services networks, and provide performance results that quantify the costs of our techniques},

	abstract = {The development of energy-conscious embedded and/or mobile systems exposes a trade-off between energy consumption and system performance. Recent microprocessors have incorporated dynamic voltage scaling as a tool that system software can use to explore this trade-off. Developing appropriate heuristics to control this feature is a non-trivial venture; as has been shown in the past, voltage-scaling heuristics that closely track perceived performance requirements do not save much energy, while those that save the most energy tend to do so at the expense of performance resulting in poor response time, for example. We note that the task of dynamically scaling processor speed and voltage to meet changing performance requirements resembles a classical control-systems problem, and so we apply a bit of control theory to the task in order to define a new voltage-scaling algorithm. We find that, using our {nqPID} (not quite {PID)} algorithm, one can improve upon the current best-of-class heuristic Pering's {AVGN} algorithm, based on Govil's {AGED} {AVERAGES} algorithm and Weiser's {PAST} algorithm in both energy consumption and performance. The study is execution-based, not-trace-based; the voltage-scaling heuristics were integrated into an embedded operating system running on a Motorola M-{CORE} processor model. The applications studied are all members of the {MediaBench} benchmark suite.},

The long standing programmes involving large industries, through interruptible tariffs and time of day pricing, have been increasingly complemented by programmes aimed at commercial and residential customer groups. Developments in {DR} vary substantially across Europe reflecting national conditions and triggered by different sets of policies, programmes and implementation schemes. This paper examines experiences within European countries as well as at European Union ({EU)} level, with the aim of understanding which factors have facilitated or impeded advances in {DR.} It describes initiatives, studies and policies of various European countries, with in-depth case studies of the {UK}, Italy and Spain. It is concluded that while business programmes, technical and economic potentials vary across Europe, there are common reasons as to why coordinated {DR} policies have been slow to emerge. This is because of the limited knowledge on {DR} energy saving capacities; high cost estimates for {DR} technologies and infrastructures; and policies focused on creating the conditions for liberalising the {EU} energy markets.},

	abstract = {Energy production must continuously match demand on the electric grid. A deficiency can lead to service disruptions, and a surplus can place tremendous stress on grid components, potentially causing major blackouts. To manage this balance, grid operators must increase or lower power generation, with only a few minutes to react. The grid balancing problem has also impeded the pace of integrating bountiful renewable resources (e.g., wind), whose generation is intermittent. An emerging plan to mitigate this problem is demand response, i.e., for grid operators to alter the electricity usage behavior of the masses through real-time price signals. But due to prohibitively high infrastructure costs and societal-scale adoption, tangible demand response mechanisms have so far been elusive. We believe that altering the usage patterns of a multitude of data centers can be a tangible, albeit initial, step towards affecting demand response. Growing in both density and size, today's data center designs are shaped by the increasing awareness of energy costs and carbon footprint. We posit that shifting computational workloads (and thus, demand) across geographic regions to match electricity supply may help balance the grid. In this paper we will first present a real grid balancing problem experienced in the Pacfic Northwest. We then propose a symbiotic relationship between data centers and grid operators by showing that mutual cost benefits can be accessible. Finally, we argue for a low cost workload migration mechanism, and pose overarching challenges in designing this framework.},

This paper presents a stochastic model to schedule reserves provided by {DR} in the wholesale electricity markets. Demand-side reserve is supplied by demand response providers ({DRPs)}, which have the responsibility of aggregating and managing customer responses. A mixed-integer representation of reserve provided by {DRPs} and its associated cost function are used in the proposed stochastic model. The proposed stochastic model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming ({SMIP)} problem. The first-stage involves network-constrained unit commitment in the base case and the second-stage investigates security assurance in system scenarios. The proposed model would schedule reserves provided by {DRPs} and determine commitment states of generating units and their scheduled energy and spinning reserves in the scheduling horizon. The proposed approach is applied to two test systems to illustrate the benefits of implementing demand-side reserve in electricity markets.},

It has the potential to provide significant peak demand reduction and to ease the incorporation of renewable energy into the grid. Data centers' participation in demand response is becoming increasingly important given the high and increasing energy consumption and the flexibility in demand management in data centers compared to conventional industrial facilities. In this extended abstract we briefly describe recent work in our full paper on two demand response schemes to reduce a data center's peak loads and energy expenditure: workload shifting and the use of local power generations. In our full paper, we conduct a detailed characterization study of coincident peak data over two decades from Fort Collins Utilities, Colorado and then develop two algorithms for data centers by combining workload scheduling and local power generation to avoid the coincident peak and reduce the energy expenditure. The first algorithm optimizes the expected cost and the second one provides a good worst-case guarantee for any coincident peak pattern. We evaluate these algorithms via numerical simulations based on real world traces from production systems. The results show that using workload shifting in combination with local generation can provide significant cost savings (up to 40\% in the Fort Collins Utilities' case) compared to either alone.},

Internet server applications execute in a horizontally scalable topology across hundreds or thousands of commodity servers in an Internet data center. Increasing scale and power density have a significant impact on the data center's thermal properties. Effective thermal management is essential to the robustness of mission-critical applications. Internet service architectures can address multisystem resource management and thermal management at the granularity of data centers. This article presents a framework for thermal-load balancing by applying load monitoring and dynamic workload placement to manage the thermal distribution within a data center. The results demonstrate that dynamic thermal management based on asymmetric workload placement can promote uniform temperature distribution that reduces local hot spots, quickly responds to thermal emergencies, reduces energy consumption costs, reduces initial cooling system capital costs and improves equipment reliability.},

	abstract = {The number of cloud service users has increased worldwide, and cloud service providers have been deploying and operating data centers to serve the globally distributed cloud users. The resource capacity of a data center is limited, so distributing the load to global data centers will be effective in providing stable services. Another issue in cloud computing is the need for providers to guarantee the service level agreements ({SLAs)} established with consumers. Whereas various load balancing algorithms have been developed, it is necessary to avoid {SLA} violations (e.g., service response time) when a cloud provider allocates the load to data centers geographically distributed across the world. Considering load balancing and guaranteed {SLA}, therefore, this paper proposes an {SLA-based} cloud computing framework to facilitate resource allocation that takes into account the workload and geographical location of distributed data centers. The contributions of this paper include: (1) the design of a cloud computing framework that includes an automated {SLA} negotiation mechanism and a workload- and location-aware resource allocation scheme ({WLARA)}, and (2) the implementation of an agent-based cloud testbed of the proposed framework. Using the testbed, experiments were conducted to compare the proposed schemes with related approaches. Empirical results show that the proposed {WLARA} performs better than other related approaches (e.g., round robin, greedy, and manual allocation) in terms of {SLA} violations and the provider's profits. We also show that using the automated {SLA} negotiation mechanism supports providers in earning higher profits.},

Because certain physical locations inside the data center are more efficient to cool than others, this suggests that allocating heavy computational workloads onto those servers that are in more efficient places might bring substantial savings.

(2) How substantial is the savings? We performed a set of experiments in a thermally isolated portion of a real data center, and validated that the potential savings is substantial and therefore warrants further work in this area to exploit the savings opportunity.},

These features range from simple reporting applications like Insights for the Facebook Advertisers, to more advanced kinds such as friend recommendations. In order to support this diversity of use cases on the ever increasing amount of data, a flexible infrastructure that scales up in a cost effective manner, is critical. We have leveraged, authored and contributed to a number of open source technologies in order to address these requirements at Facebook. These include Scribe, Hadoop and Hive which together form the cornerstones of the log collection, storage and analytics infrastructure at Facebook. In this paper we will present how these systems have come together and enabled us to implement a data warehouse that stores more than {15PB} of data ({2.5PB} after compression) and loads more than {60TB} of new data ({10TB} after compression) every day.

We ran simulations to explore the potential for data centres to adapt to dynamic electrical prices, variation in carbon intensity within an electrical grid, or the availability of local renewables. Using workloads from the Parallel Workloads Archive alongside real-world pricing data, we demonstrate potential savings on the cost of electricity ranging typically between 10-50\%. Adaptation to the variation in the electrical grid carbon intensity was not as successful, but adaptation to the availability of local renewables showed potential to significantly increase their use. In one example the fraction of power obtained from a local wind installation increased by 10-80\%.},

Currently, many {ISOs} have designed programs to utilize the reserve provided by {DR} in electricity markets. This paper presents a stochastic model to schedule reserves provided by {DR} in the wholesale electricity markets. Demand-side reserve is supplied by demand response providers ({DRPs)}, which have the responsibility of aggregating and managing customer responses. A mixed-integer representation of reserve provided by {DRPs} and its associated cost function are used in the proposed stochastic model. The proposed stochastic model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming ({SMIP)} problem. The first-stage involves network-constrained unit commitment in the base case and the second-stage investigates security assurance in system scenarios. The proposed model would schedule reserves provided by {DRPs} and determine commitment states of generating units and their scheduled energy and spinning reserves in the scheduling horizon. The proposed approach is applied to two test systems to illustrate the benefits of implementing demand-side reserve in electricity markets.},

In section {II}, we move from the fundamentals to specific issues of implementing time-varying prices. We begin by describing illustrative Realtime Pricing and Critical Peak Pricing tariffs that are in use today. We then address the actual development of dynamic retail prices. In section {III}, we examine the ways in which customers respond to time-varying and dynamic prices. We discuss both the potential responses that are envisioned by those who study optimization of power use and the actual responses that have taken place in pilot and long-term programs. We conclude in section {IV} by advocating much wider use of dynamic retail pricing, under which prices faced by end-use customers can be adjusted frequently and on short notice to reflect changes in wholesale prices and the supply/demand balance.},

	abstract = {Power-aware scheduling problem has been a recent issue in cluster systems not only for operational cost due to electricity cost, but also for system reliability. As recent commodity processors support multiple operating points under various supply voltage levels, Dynamic Voltage Scaling ({DVS)} scheduling algorithms can reduce power consumption by controlling appropriate voltage levels. In this paper, we provide power-aware scheduling algorithms for bag-of-tasks applications with deadline constraints on {DVS-enabled} cluster systems in order to minimize power consumption as well as to meet the deadlines specified by application users. A bag-of-tasks application should finish all the sub-tasks before the deadline, so that the {DVS} scheduling scheme should consider the deadline as well. We provide the {DVS} scheduling algorithms for both time-shared and space-shared resource sharing policies. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms reduce much power consumption compared to static voltage schemes.},

These distributed systems leverage commodity server hardware in mass quantity, similar in theory to many of the fastest Supercomputers in existence today. However these systems can consume a cities worth of power just to run idle, and require equally massive cooling systems to keep the servers within normal operating temperatures. This produces {CO2} emissions and significantly contributes to the growing environmental issue of Global Warming. Green computing, a new trend for high-end computing, attempts to alleviate this problem by delivering both high performance and reduced power consumption, effectively maximizing total system efficiency. This paper focuses on scheduling virtual machines in a compute cluster to reduce power consumption via the technique of Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling ({DVFS).} Specifically, we present the design and implementation of an efficient scheduling algorithm to allocate virtual machines in a {DVFS-enabled} cluster by dynamically scaling the supplied voltages. The algorithm is studied via simulation and implementation in a multi-core cluster. Test results and performance discussion justify the design and implementation of the scheduling algorithm.},

	abstract = {{Abstract—The} study of Cyber-Physical System ({CPS)} has been an active area of research. Internet Data Center ({IDC)} is an important emerging Cyber-Physical System. As the demand on Internet services drastically increases in recent years, the power used by {IDCs} has been skyrocketing. While most existing research focuses on reducing power consumptions of {IDCs}, the power management problem for minimizing the total electricity cost has been overlooked. This is an important problem faced by service providers, especially in the current multi-electricity market, where the price of electricity may exhibit time and location diversities. Further, for these service providers, guaranteeing quality of service (i.e. service level objectives-{SLO)} such as service delay guarantees to the end users is of paramount importance. This paper studies the problem of minimizing the total electricity cost under multiple electricity markets environment while guaranteeing quality of service geared to the location diversity and time diversity of electricity price. We model the problem as a constrained mixed-integer programming and propose an efficient solution method. Extensive evaluations based on reallife electricity price data for multiple {IDC} locations illustrate the efficiency and efficacy of our approach. I.},

	abstract = {Energy expenditure has become a significant fraction of data center operating costs. Recently, “geographical load balancing” has been suggested to reduce energy cost by exploiting the electricity price differences across regions. However, this reduction of cost can paradoxically increase total energy use. This paper explores whether the geographical diversity of Internet-scale systems can additionally be used to provide environmental gains. Specifically, we explore whether geographical load balancing can encourage use of“green”renewable energy and reduce use of “brown ” fossil fuel energy. We make two contributions. First, we derive two distributed algorithms for achieving optimal geographical load balancing. Second, we show that if electricity is dynamically priced in proportion to the instantaneous fraction of the total energy that is brown, then geographical load balancing provides significant reductions in brown energy use. However, the benefits depend strongly on the degree to which systems accept dynamic energy pricing and the form of pricing used.},

We identify two causes of this inefficiency: low server utilization and a lack of power-proportionality. To address this problem we present a design for an power-proportional cluster consisting of a power-aware cluster manager and a set of heterogeneous machines. Our design makes use of currently available energy-efficient hardware, mechanisms for transitioning in and out of low-power sleep states, and dynamic provisioning and scheduling to continually adjust to workload and minimize power consumption. With our design we are able to reduce energy consumption while maintaining acceptable response times for a web service workload based on Wikipedia. With our dynamic provisioning algorithms we demonstrate via simulation a 63\% savings in power usage in a typically provisioned datacenter where all machines are left on and awake at all times. Our results show that we are able to achieve close to 90\% of the savings a theoretically optimal provisioning scheme would achieve. We have also built a prototype cluster which runs Wikipedia to demonstrate the use of our design in a real environment.},

	abstract = {The demand for data center solutions with lower total cost of ownership and lower complexity of management is driving the creation of next generation datacenters The information technology industry is in the midst of a transformation to lower the cost of operation through consolidation and better utilization of critical data center resources. Successful consolidation necessitates increasing utilization of capital intensive "always-on" data center infrastructure, and reducing the recurring cost of power. A need exists, therefore for an end to end methodology that can be used to design and manage dense data centers and determine the cost of operating a data center. The chip core to the cooling tower model must capture the power levels and thermo-fluids behavior of chips, systems, aggregation of systems in racks, rows of racks, room flow distribution, air conditioning equipment, hydronics, vapor compression systems, pumps and heat exchangers. Earlier work has outlined the foundation for creation of a "smart" data center through use of flexible cooling resources and a distributed sensing and control system that can provision the cooling resources based on the need. This paper shows a common platform which serves as an evaluation and basis for policy based control engine for such a "smart" data center with much broader reach -- from chip core to the cooling tower. In this paper, we propose a data center solution, which has three components: Cooling, Power and Compute. These three components collectively improve efficiency and manageability of the data center by supporting greater compaction, flexible building blocks that can be dynamically configured, dynamic optimization, better monitoring and visualization, and policy-based control. Coefficient of performance ({COP)} of the ensemble is defined that represents an overall measure of the efficiency of performance of energy flow during the operation of a data center.},

Thermal management of data centers can address dominant problems associated with cooling such as the recirculation of hot air from the equipment outlets to their inlets, and the appearance of hot spots. In this paper, we are looking into assigning the incoming tasks to machines of a data center in such a way so as to affect the heat recirculation and make cooling more efficient. Using a low complexity linear heat recirculation model, we formulate the problem of minimizing the peak inlet temperature within a data center through task assignment, consequently leading to minimal cooling power consumption. We also provide two methods to solve the formulation, one that uses a genetic algorithm and the other that uses sequential quadratic programming. We show through formalization that minimizing the peak inlet temperature allows for the lowest cooling power needs. Results from a simulated, small-scale data center show that solving the formulation leads to an inlet temperature distribution that is 2 {°C} to 5 {°C} lower compared to other approaches, and achieves about 20\%-30\% cooling energy savings at moderate data center utilization rates. Moreover, our algorithms consistently outperform {MinHR}, a recirculation-reducing placement algorithm in the literature.},

The effects of applying a number of different bus-level {HP} control algorithms are evaluated.

We first examine a theoretic thermodynamic formulation that uses information about steady state hot spots and cold spots in the data center and develop real-world scheduling algorithms. Based on the insights from these results, we develop an alternate approach. Our new approach leverages the non-intuitive observation that the source of cooling inefficiencies can often be in locations spatially uncorrelated with its manifested consequences; this enables additional energy savings. Overall, our results demonstrate up to a factor of two reduction in annual data center cooling costs over location-agnostic workload distribution, purely through software optimizations without the need for any costly capital investment.},

Our evaluation studies the ability of different cooling strategies to handle load spikes, compares the behaviors of our dynamic cost-aware policies to cost-unaware and static policies, and explores the effects of many parameter settings. Among other interesting results, we demonstrate that (1) our policies can provide large cost savings, (2) load migration enables savings in many scenarios, and (3) all electricity-related costs must be considered at the same time for higher and consistent cost savings.},

	abstract = {Scheduling jobs on the {IBM} {SP2} system and many other distributed-memory {MPPs} is usually done by giving each job a partition of the machine for its exclusive use. Allocating such partitions in the order in which the jobs arrive ({FCFS} scheduling) is fair and predictable, but suffers from severe fragmentation, leading to low utilization. This situation led to the development of the {EASY} scheduler which uses aggressive backfilling: Small jobs are moved ahead to fill in holes in the schedule, provided they do not delay the first job in the queue. We compare this approach with a more conservative approach in which small jobs move ahead only if they do not delay any job in the queue and show that the relative performance of the two schemes depends on the workload: For workloads typical on {SP2} systems, the aggressive approach is indeed better, but, for other workloads, both algorithms are similar. In addition, we study the sensitivity of backfilling to the accuracy of the runtime estimates provided by the users and find a very surprising result: Backfilling actually works better when users overestimate the runtime by a substantial factor.},

	abstract = {During the past five years scientists discovered that modern {UNIX} workstations connected with ethernet and ber networks could provide enough computational performance to compete with the supercomputers of the day. As this concept became increasingly popular, the need for distributed queuing and scheduling systems became apparent. Systems such as {DQS} from Florida State were developed and worked very well. Today, supercomputers, such as Argonne National Laboratory's {IBM} {SP} system, can provide more {CPU} and networking speed than can be obtained from these networks of workstations. These modern supercomputers look like clusters of workstations, however, so developers felt that the scheduling systems that were previously used on clusters of workstations should still apply. After trying to apply some of these scheduling systems to Argonne's {SP} environment, it became obvious that these two computer environments have very di erent scheduling needs. Recognizing this need and realizing that no one has addressed it, I developed a new scheduling system. The approach taken in creating this system was unique in that user input and interaction were encouraged throughout the development process. Thus, ascheduler was built that actually \&quot;worked \&quot; the way the users wanted it to work.},

Motivated by these concerns, we have developed a general resource management architecture for Grid environments, in which resource co-allocation is an integral component. We examine the co-allocation problem in detail and present mechanisms that allow an application to guide resource selection during the co-allocation process; these mechanisms address issues relating to the allocation, monitoring, control, and configuration of distributed computations. We describe the implementation of co-allocators based on these mechanisms and present the results of microbenchmark studies and large-scale application experiments that provide insights into the costs and practical utility of our techniques},

For time-critical emergency decision support applications, such as influenza modeling and severe weather prediction, late results may be useless. A specialized infrastructure is needed to provide computational resources quickly. This paper describes the architecture and implementation of {SPRUCE}, a system for supporting urgent computing on both traditional supercomputers and distributed computing Grids. Currently deployed on the {TeraGrid}, {SPRUCE} provides users with “right-of-way tokens ” that can be activated from a Web-based portal or Web service invocation in the event of an urgent computing need. Tokens are transferrable and can be restricted to specific resource sets and priority levels. Once a session is activated, job submissions may request elevated priority. Based on local policy, computing resources can respond, for example, by preempting active jobs or raising the job’s priority in the queue. This paper also explores the strengths and weaknesses of the {SPRUCE} architecture and token-based activation for urgent computing applications. 1},

However, there are many opportunities for greater efficiency through integrated design and management of data center components. To that end, we propose a sustainable data center that replaces conventional resource delivery models with a framework centered around the supply and demand side management of all data center resources including {IT}, power and cooling. We have identified five elements for achieving this vision: data center scale lifecycle design, flexible and configurable building blocks, pervasive cross-layer sensing, knowledge discovery and visualization, and autonomous control. We describe these principles and provide selected results that quantify the potential for savings.},

	abstract = {Data center power consumption is growing to unprecedented levels: the {EPA} estimates {U.S.} data centers will consume 100 billion kilowatt hours annually by 2011. Much of this energy is wasted in idle systems: in typical deployments, server utilization is below 30\%, but idle servers still consume 60\% of their peak power draw. Typical idle periods---though frequent---last seconds or less, confounding simple energy-conservation approaches. In this article, we propose {PowerNap}, an energy-conservation approach where the entire system transitions rapidly between a high-performance active state and a near-zero-power idle state in response to instantaneous load. Rather than requiring fine-grained power-performance states and complex load-proportional operation from individual system components, {PowerNap} instead calls for minimizing idle power and transition time, which are simpler optimization goals. Based on the {PowerNap} concept, we develop requirements and outline mechanisms to eliminate idle power waste in enterprise blade servers. Because {PowerNap} operates in low-efficiency regions of current blade center power supplies, we introduce the Redundant Array for Inexpensive Load Sharing ({RAILS)}, a power provisioning approach that provides high conversion efficiency across the entire range of {PowerNap’s} power demands. Using utilization traces collected from enterprise-scale commercial deployments, we demonstrate that, together, {PowerNap} and {RAILS} reduce average server power consumption by 74\%.},

	abstract = {A world consisting of billions of service-oriented client devices and thousands of data centers can deliver a diverse range of services, from social networking to management of our natural resources. However, these services must scale in order to meet the fundamental needs of society. To enable such scaling, the total cost of ownership of the data centers that host the services and comprise the vast majority of service delivery costs will need to be reduced. As energy drives the total cost of ownership of data centers, there is a need for a new paradigm in design and management of data centers that minimizes energy used across their lifetimes, from “cradle to cradle”. This tutorial article presents a blueprint for a “net-zero data center”: one that offsets any electricity used from the grid via adequate on-site power generation that gets fed back to the grid at a later time. We discuss how such a data center addresses the total cost of ownership, illustrating that contrary to the oft-held view of sustainability as “paying more to be green”, sustainable data centers—built on a framework that focuses on integrating supply and demand management from end-to-end—can concurrently lead to lowest cost and lowest environmental impact.},

Efficient management of data centers, including power management, networking, and cooling infrastructure, is hence crucial to sustainability. In the absence of a 'first-principles' approach to manage these complex components and their interactions, data-driven approaches have become attractive and tenable. Results: We present a temporal data mining solution to model and optimize performance of data center chillers, a key component of the cooling infrastructure. It helps bridge raw, numeric, time-series information from sensor streams toward higher level characterizations of chiller behavior, suitable for a data center engineer. To aid in this transduction, temporal data streams are first encoded into a symbolic representation, next run-length encoded segments are mined to form frequent motifs in time series, and finally these metrics are evaluated by their contributions to sustainability. A key innovation in our application is the ability to intersperse "don't care" transitions (e.g., transients) in continuous-valued time series data, an advantage we inherit by the application of frequent episode mining to symbolized representations of numeric time series. Our approach provides both qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the sensor streams to the data center engineer, to aid him in tuning chiller operating characteristics. This system is currently being prototyped for a data center managed by {HP} and experimental results from this application reveal the promise of our approach.},

In this paper, we present Yank, which uses a transient server abstraction to maintain server availability, while allowing data centers to "pull the plug" if power becomes unavailable. A transient server's defining characteristic is that it may terminate anytime after a brief advance warning period. Yank exploits the advance warning--on the order of a few seconds--to provide high availability cheaply and efficiently at large scales by enabling each backup server to maintain "live" memory and disk snapshots for many transient {VMs.} We implement Yank inside of Xen. Our experiments show that a backup server can concurrently support up to 15 transient {VMs} with minimal performance degradation with advance warnings as small as 10 seconds, even when {VMs} run memory-intensive interactive web applications.},

Big Data compute model mandates strong data-locality for computational performance, and moves computations to data. State-of-the-art cooling energy management techniques rely on thermal-aware computational job placement/migration and are inherently data-placement-agnostic in nature. T* takes a novel, data-centric approach to reduce cooling energy costs and to ensure thermal-reliability of the servers. T* is cognizant of the uneven thermal-profile and differences in thermal-reliability-driven load thresholds of the servers, and the differences in the computational jobs arrival rate, size, and evolution life spans of the Big Data placed in the cluster. Based on this knowledge, and coupled with its predictive file models and insights, T* does proactive, thermal-aware file placement, which implicitly results in thermal-aware job placement in the Big Data analytics compute model. Evaluation results with one-month long real-world Big Data analytics production traces from Yahoo! show up to 42\% reduction in the cooling energy costs with T* courtesy of its lower and more uniform thermal-profile and 9x better performance than the state-of-the-art data-agnostic cooling techniques.},
