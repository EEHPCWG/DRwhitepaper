As the HPC community moves towards exascale computing\footnote{Exascale computing refers to computing systems capable of at
least \(10^{18}\)FLOPS.}, we anticipate that a growing number of facilities will
be reaching or exceeding these service levels, with significant potential 
effect on electrical grid reliability.
In this paper we seek to understand how these anticipated
usage patterns can be integrated safely into the power grid with minimal cost 
and disruption in order to manage

this risk.

%TP: Specify 'electrical' grid as this is unclear
Being a ``good citizen'' on the electrical grid has several historical precedents.
%TP: Change "`For Example"' to "`In the past" because 'For example' is used soon after.
In the past, electrically-intensive industries such as aluminum smelters 
have received preferential pricing in return for predictable loads and
flexibility in reducing power during periods of high consumption.
SCs are already adopting these strategies.  
For example, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
reduces its power usage when temperatures exceed 
100 degrees and the residential power usage in the area surges.

A mutual understanding of concerns between SCs and ESPs can

paradigm, paving the way for possible integration of %HPC TP: replace HPC with SCs
SCs with the electrical grid. Grid Integration in the context of this study refers to the dynamic interaction and value between the demand-side resources (SCs) and the supply-side resources (ESPs) and the electricity grid and its markets.

The Energy Efficient HPC Working Group (\href {http://eehpcwg.lbl.gov/}{EE HPC WG})  
investigates opportunities for large supercomputing sites to  
integrate more closely with their ESPs.
We seek to understand the willingness of SCs to
cooperate with their ESPs, their expectations from their ESPs, and the feasible measures
that SCs could employ to help their ESPs.
To achieve our objectives we developed a questionnaire and distributed it to 
the Top100 SCs in the United States.

This paper %TP replace 'work' with 'paper'

This integration model describes programs that are used by some of the ESPs %electricity service providers

used to balance the electrical grid supply and demand. This is referred to as \emph{demand response (DR)}.

One of the most straightforward ways that SCs can begin

with their ESPs, facilitating both energy efficiency and grid reliability. In addition, this will provide for extensive funding and cost analysis and help the community base future requirements for SCs and ESPs on facts and a proven set of measurements.

The paper is organized as follows.
Sections~\ref{sec:ESPintegration} and~\ref{sec:supercomputercenters} of this paper
describe in greater detail the model for 
integrating SCs and the electrical grid.
Section~\ref{sub:priorwork}
reviews prior work in SC strategies. %TP: HPC replaced with supercomputing
Section~\ref{sec:questionnaire} provides the results of the questionnaire. 
Section~\ref{sec:opportunities} 
discusses the several opportunities, solutions and barriers that have been highlighted
by the survey results. We offer our conclusions in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} along with our plan for future work.  
The \nameref{Appendix} summarizes the survey questions.
