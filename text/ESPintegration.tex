The EE HPC WG took as their starting point a
model developed by LBNL's Demand Response Research
Center that describes strategies that datacenters might em-
ploy for utility programs to manage their electricity and
power requirements to lower costs and benefit from utility
incentives. The EE HPC WG adopted this model with
slight tweaks to reflect the supercomputing environment
focus (versus the datacenter as described by LBNL`s Demand
Response Research Center).

For purposes of this paper, we define supercomputer centers
as distinct from a datacenters as having 
significantly higher system utilization and thus little or no 
virtualization.  Additionally, supercomputer
applications are distinguished by their lack of geographical
portability due to security concerns, data size and machine-specific
optimization.  We also note  that supercomputing centers tend to be more
energy-efficient than datacenters.  
In our survey, no SC exceeded a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of $1.53$,
while the average data center falls between $1.91$ and $2.9$ (with $1.0$ being
the ideal).~\cite{FIXME}

\subsection{Electricity Provider Programs\\
and Methods}
\label{sub:EPP}
An electricity provider seeks to provide efficient and reliable generation, transmission, and 
distribution of electricity. Methods and programs employed by the electricity providers and their consumers 
are key to managing and balancing the supply and demand of electricity. While the \textit{methods} 
describe how 
electricity providers manage supply, the \textit{programs} describe the activities that 
the electricity providers 
can offer to their consumers to balance demand with supply.

Although critical to the eletricity service providers, methods 
are generally not visible to the consumer of the electricity because they
operate within the generation  or transmission stations.
These methods are the major means by which supply and demand of electricity are managed.

Electricity provider programs encourage customer responses to target both energy efficiency and real-time
(day-ahead or day-of) management of demand for electricity. An example of an electricity provider program 
that encourages energy efficiency would be to provide home consumers a financial incentive for replacing 
single pane with double pane windows.  On the other hand, an example that illustrates programs that help 
with real-time demand management would be to provide a financial incentive for reducing load 
during high demand periods 
(such as hot summer afternoons when air conditioners are heavily utilized). 

The following is a list and brief definitions of key methods and programs.  

\subsubsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
\item Regulation (Up or Down): Methods used to maintain that portion of electricity generation reserves 
that are needed to balance generation and demand at all times.  Raising supply is up regulation and lowering 
supply is down regulation. There are many types of reserves 
(e.g., operating, ancillary services), distinguished by who manages them and what they are used for.

\item Transmission Congestion: Methods used to resolve congestion that occurs when there is not enough 
transmission capability to support all requests for transmission services. Transmission system operators 
must re-dispatch generation or, 
in the limit, deny some of these requests to prevent transmission lines from becoming overloaded.

\item Distribution Congestion:  Methods used to resolve congestion that occurs when the 
distribution control system 
is overloaded.  It generally results in deliveries that are held up or delayed.  

\item Frequency response:  Methods used to keep grid frequency constant and in-balance. 
Generators are typically used for frequency response, but any appliance that operates to a duty cycle 
(such as air conditioners and heat pumps) could be used to provide a 
constant and reliable grid balancing service by timing their duty cycles in response to system load.   

\item Grid Scale Storage:  Methods used to store electricity on a large scale. 
Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage. 

\item Renewables:  Methods used to manage the variable uncertain generation nature of 
many renewable resources. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Programs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Energy Efficiency:  Programs used to reduce overall electricity consumption.

\item Peak Shedding:  Programs used to reduce load during peak times, 
where the reduced load is not used at a later time. 

\item Peak Shifting:  Programs where the load during peak times is moved to, typically, non-peak hours. 

\item Dynamic Pricing:  Time varying pricing programs used to increase, shed,
 or shift electricity consumption. 
The two types of pricing are peak and real-time.  Peak pricing is pre-scheduled; however, the consumer 
does not know if a certain day will be a peak or a non-peak day until day-ahead or day-of.  
Real-time pricing is not pre-scheduled; prices can be set day-ahead or day-of.
\end{itemize}

Although these methods and programs have historically not been relevant to supercomputer centers,
the following example illustrates their potential relevance.
The generation capacity requirements and response timescales vary across the country for electricity 
providers and operators. For example, the New England independent system operator (ISO-NE) uses a method 
of regulation and reserves that relies heavily on a day-ahead market program. This provides an opportunity 
for demand side resources---like supercomputer centers with renewable energy sources---to participate in the 
market supplying the ISO-NE with electricity.  It also makes the ISO-NE particularly sensitive to major 
fluctuations in electricity demand, which, as discussed further in the questionnaire section, is an emerging 
characteristic of the largest supercomputer centers.

This paper assumes that the given grid is a constant. However, it is expected 
that future grid infrastructures will 
evolve with smart-grid capabilities.
